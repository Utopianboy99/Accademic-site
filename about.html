        <p id="about-text">Vibrant, multicultural and dynamic, the UA Academia shares the pace and energy of 
            cosmopolitan Johannesburg, the city whose name it carries. Proudly South African, the university is 
            alive down to its African roots, and well-prepared for its role in actualising the potential that 
            higher education holds for the continent’s development. UAA has transformed into a diverse, inclusive,
            transformational and collegial institution, with a student population of over 50 000, of which more 
            than 3000 are international students from 80 countries. This makes UAA one of the largest contact 
            <br>
            <br>
            universities in South Africa (SA) from the 26 public universities that make up the higher education system.
            The vision of the UAA is to be “an international University of choice, anchored in Africa, 
            dynamically shaping the future”. The mission can be described as follows: “inspiring its 
            community to transform and serve humanity through innovation and the collaborative pursuit 
            of knowledge”. These are underpinned by four values, namely: imagination, conversation, 
            regeneration and ethical foundation. The six strategic objectives provide a focused means 
            for realising the Vision, Mission and Values of the University as set out above. They further 
            represent a re-working of the original UAA Strategic Thrusts 2020 in the context of a wider 
            positioning of the University as “The Pan-African” Centre for Critical Intellectual Inquiry, 
            with the primary goal of achieving global excellence and stature.

        <p>Recognised as the country’s second strongest brand, UAA offers world-class, internationally
           recognised academic programmes based on curricula informed by cutting-edge developments 
           in both undergraduate and postgraduate education, and that are designed to prepare students 
           for the world of work and for global citizenship. Our curriculum is increasingly reflective 
           of previously marginalised scholarship that talks to a transformation and decolonisation agenda,
           with Africa at its core.
